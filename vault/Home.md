Dashboard for the TuRTS studio. Read this first, then [[Tasks]] and the latest note in Reports.

# TuRTS studio

**Product:** mod-first RTS engine in Rust and Bevy. Browser WebAssembly client first, authoritative headless server, the official game is a default mod on the public API. Spec: `RTS-Engine-Project-Specifications.md` (v0.7, 2026-10-26).

**Current milestone:** M3 industrial loop, wave W10. T0, T1, T2, T3a, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12, T13a and T13b accepted (16/20 task entries). C1/C2 passed; protocol/export accepted; conservation suite under review; client ingest starts. Live progress: [[M3 Execution Board]].

**Phase:** M3 schema API0.2.1 is accepted; the M2 stream is frozen and green. Last canonical gates: 700 passed, 0 failed, 17 ignored; fmt, strict Clippy, workspace check, wasm and boundary passed. Extraction, conveyors, inserters, machine recipes, research and combat are accepted; the complete industrial chain is still pending.

**M2 baseline:** M1 closed; M2 Tasks 1–16 accepted at canonical source `601e71286e56bd2cbed0ecf9f0240ebcecd63047`. The multiplayer graybox proves the public package path, two-owner server-authoritative economy interactions, browser/native rendered controls, and recovery. Final process acceptance, T7, 15 browser positives, 33 native mutation plants, and 8 browser mutation plants passed. Global workspace tests: 497 passed, 0 failed, 17 ignored across 72 groups. Exact artifacts and hashes are in `docs/measurements/m2.md`. Remote GitHub Actions was not run for this closeout; performance budgets remain open.

## Where to look

- [[Tasks]]: the board.
- [[Team]]: the sixteen agents, model tiers, review process.
- [[M3 Execution Board]]: M3 run sheet for the Codex agents (tasks, reviewers, validators, waves, ledger).
- `Decisions/`: one note per decision. Start with [[Decisions/2026-10-26 Bevy 0.20]].
- `Work Log/`: one note per day.
- `Reports/`: the daily report for the CEO.
- `Knowledge/`: verified facts the studio relies on.

## Standing CEO items

- License: TBD (CEO's words). No LICENSE file until chosen.
- Desktop delivery (D02, native or Tauri wrapper): the M1 acceptance row names a secondary executable. The studio proposes to accept the browser part of M1 now and block the executable part on this decision.
