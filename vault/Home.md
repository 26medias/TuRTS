## For future Claude
Dashboard for the TuRTS studio. Read this first, then [[Tasks]] and the latest note in Reports.

# TuRTS studio

**Product:** mod-first RTS engine in Rust and Bevy. Browser WebAssembly client first, authoritative headless server, the official game is a default mod on the public API. Spec: `RTS-Engine-Project-Specifications.md` (v0.7, 2026-10-26).

**Current milestone:** M1 done. Next: M2, mod API proven by the default mod plus an alternative economy mod.

**Phase:** M1 is closed. M2 Tasks 1–8 are complete after review and canonical integration; original plan progress is 8/16. The post-Task 8 locked workspace suite passed 376 tests, 0 failed, 12 ignored across 65 groups; fmt, locked check, strict Clippy, boundary, locked wasm and the named economy_accounting target (42/42) passed. Task 9 has a reviewed isolated preview (M1/package process and Chrome T7 passed), but remains incomplete pending canonical data integration, positive base/haul economy loops, and Task 8 oracle validation. Handoff and exact base-to-preview diff are in canonical private SDD. Client queue prep is integrated without protocol activation; protocol 1 remains selected.

**Repository:** https://github.com/26medias/TuRTS (public). CI green.

## Where to look

- [[Tasks]]: the board.
- [[Team]]: the sixteen agents, model tiers, review process.
- `Decisions/`: one note per decision. Start with [[Decisions/2026-10-26 Bevy 0.20]].
- `Work Log/`: one note per day.
- `Reports/`: the daily report for the CEO.
- `Knowledge/`: verified facts the studio relies on.

## Standing CEO items

- License: TBD (CEO's words). No LICENSE file until chosen.
- Desktop delivery (D02, native or Tauri wrapper): the M1 acceptance row names a secondary executable. The studio proposes to accept the browser part of M1 now and block the executable part on this decision.
