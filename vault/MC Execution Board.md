# MC execution board

State: ACTIVE. T1, T2a and T3 are complete. T3 merged at aceef85; integration G-RUST, G-QA, G-FROZEN and G-WEB passed. Headed Vulkan T7 passed with 115 frames and the server oracle, exit=0. T20 now receives the single compiler cache for its clean-tree M2 baseline. Build runs: 12/170. Wave 1 is incomplete; no integration push or new CI yet.

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-29-mc-player-control.md`.
Design of record: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-29-mc-player-control-design.md`, revision 10 at `488b3d3`.
Brief: [[Reports/2026-10-29 MC Codex brief]].
Original base: `a0a3076`; rebased on CEO instruction to `main` at `f503cff`; integration: `codex/mc-integration`, worktree `/home/julien/Projects/TuRTS-mc-integration`.
Task 1 lane: `codex/mc-t1`, worktree `/home/julien/Projects/TuRTS-mc-t1`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/mc-t1`.
Main stays at `f503cff`. The pre-existing untracked disk audit stays in the main worktree.

## 1. Roles and dispatch rules

| Role | Seat | Model and effort | Work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orchestrator | root | Current Codex session; no child dispatch | Verify, merge, gate, track budget, keep vault. |
| Builder | Task seat in budget table | gpt-6-luna; high | Show red, then green; commit; gate; plants. |
| Reviewer | Task reviewer in budget table | gpt-6.1-sol; high | Separate agent; read diff, run tests and one plant; cite path:line. |
| Validator | qa-lead | Model from task; high | Validate integration for tasks 21 to 24 and plants. |
| Player | player and CEO | Sol; high for agent | CEO plays PT1 and PT2; log "not blind". |

Each dispatch must state model, effort, task, base, branch, worktree, target directory, owned paths, design sections, commands, report path and stop conditions. Count each dispatch and resumed work turn before it runs. Agent summaries are leads, not proof.

User workspace instructions take precedence over the brief's inherited role-file instructions. Do not read or import CLAUDE.md, .claude, Claude settings or marketplaces. No such file was read. Use Codex instructions and the task/design for the seat contract. The plan's required superpowers skills are not in the available Codex skill catalog. No external skill was loaded or enabled.

## 2. Standing rules

- Design revision 10 wins over the plan. Report every conflict; stop on a task step that contradicts it or the product spec.
- K1 to K27 stand as recommended. K11(a) is retained on Chrome evidence under the CEO Firefox deferral. Full design; no scope cut without CEO.
- Each task branch starts from integration after all Needs merge; one worktree and target per lane. Build binaries one at a time. Remove the lane and its target only after merge.
- Red must compile and fail semantically. Show the command and `; echo exit=$?`. Do not pipe away output before the exit code.
- Order: red, green, commit, gate, plants. Restore plants, then prove changed paths are clean. Never restore uncommitted or new files with git checkout.
- Stage explicit paths. Vault-only commits use [skip ci]. End each commit with `Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@openai.com>`.
- Verify path:line. Mark absent evidence NOT TRACED. Use ASD-STE100 prose and four spaces per indent.
- Do not edit the design, product spec or Claude configuration. Leave the plan's Doc updates section to its owner.
- Stop for P1 red, Firefox absent after at most 10 minutes outside the sandbox, frozen value change, design/spec conflict, suspect Decided item, task 18 content id collision, plant retirement without a decision, budget limit, or twice a task estimate.
- Before task 23, send the CEO the serve-only URL and wait. Tester identity is decided: CEO, not blind.

## 3. Gates and CI

Task gate sets are the plan's Local gate commands. T1 requires G-QA. After each task merge, run G-RUST, G-QA and G-FROZEN; also G-WEB for client/server edits. After each wave, push integration only and read hosted check, agents and browser jobs. Never merge or push main.

Frozen M2 SHA256: `bcbf72c2206251f635a7c7f5b6c8f573d69a5fc05a5bd77716e98ebfb08e370b`. Keep forge fixed point and refutation plants. Known browser failure: M2 browser proof; trace in T20, repair in owner task/T21. Current integration CI: NOT TRACED; no wave has completed and no push was made. T1 merged at8f612a3 after the CEO release; integration re-gate passed all commands. No wave is complete yet.

## Known red window

| Evidence | Current result | Cause and owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Historical CI 40960227409 | E9-browser-base-economy times out after 15 s. Server completed production at tick175; captured client stayed at tick87. | Underlying cause NOT TRACED. Historical artifact and log retained under target/mc-evidence/t20-builder. |
| T20 clean local baseline at22a4600 | Selection, economy and recovery pass; E9-browser-base-public-convergence fails its shared-tick public-projection assertion (tests/browser/m2.js:430-444), exit=1. | Investigating hidden-page suspension as a tool hypothesis. No engine owner assigned yet. Task20 must repair a proved harness/tool cause; otherwise record the proved owner. |

## 4. Tasks

24 numbered tasks; task 2 has two branches, for 25 lanes. T1 merged at8f612a3 after completion of supplementary Chrome receipts and CEO Firefox deferral. T2a is complete; T3 is in progress. T20 is prepared for its clean-tree baseline.

| Task | Wave | Needs | Branch | State |

## 5. Waves

Tasks in one wave share no file, except the refutation registries (merge in task-number order, G-REF).

| Wave | Tasks | Order reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, 2a, 3, 20 | no needs |
| 2 | 8, 18, 19 | 8 needs 2a, 3; 18 and 19 need 3 |
| 3 | 2b | needs 2a, 3, 18 (R3) |
| 4 | 4, 9 | 4 needs 2b, 3; 9 needs 1, 8, 2b |
| 5 | 6, 7, 11, 12 | 6 needs 4; 7 needs 2b, 4 (`--order-log` reads the order state); 11, 12 need 9, 19, 20 (12 also 3) |
| 6 | 5, 13 | 5 needs 4, 6, 19; 13 needs 4, 6, 9, 11, 19, 20 |
| 7 | 10, 15, 17 | 10 needs 5, 9, 11, 19, 20; 15 needs 4, 7, 12, 13; 17 needs 3, 12, 13, 19, 20 |
| 8 | 14, 16, 22 | 14 needs 5, 12, 13, 15 (`AlertPings` for the step 18 ping, re-check 1 player A); 16 needs 7, 12, 15; 22 needs 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 19, 20 (`scripts/acceptance.sh` after 10) |
| 9 | 21 | needs 14, 16, 17, 18, 20 |
| 10 | 23 | needs 14, 15, 21, 22 (and so every task) |

## 7. Budget and seats

CEO approved about 212 total runs. Build stop line: 170 (106 planned task runs plus 64 repairs). Gate estimate: 42 spent before this build. Build dispatches used: 12/170. Root preflight is recorded separately and is not a builder/reviewer dispatch. T1 estimate 3; stop at 6 task dispatches. Do not dispatch another run at a stop.

One run is one agent dispatch (builder or reviewer). Count every run on the board.

| **Total** | **about 212** | | |

## 8. Run ledger

One row per builder/reviewer dispatch or resumed agent work turn. Register before dispatch. Do not add fake red, green or reviewer results.

## 9. Preflight ledger and stop

| Event | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root setup | git status; worktree list; git show and SHA256 of design at 488b3d3 and a0a3076 | Design bytes match: 82d49b19c7e483793569cf4cd80d0b47108590e78913a8ecfa948fbed5929508. |
| P1 conflict | Design:363-364; plan:300,303 | Design requires default prevented in the output table. Plan says it is not used and omits it. STOP before implementation. |
| Precedence error | Brief section 1 versus user instruction and plan | User explicitly resolved: design revision 10 wins. Do not follow the brief's plan-wins sentence. |
| CEO decisions | Current user instruction | 212 approved; stop at 170 build runs; CEO plays both tests, not blind; exact base a0a3076. |

Historical preflight proposal: retain `defaultPrevented` in the raw records and the table, in addition to `cancelable`; use reaches-page and browser-acted for K11. No probe ran before this initial stop. O9 accepted and released this proposal below. The current stop is the Firefox result, not the column conflict.


## 10. O9 release, 2026-10-30

CEO relayed ruling O9 at f503cff and released the P1 preflight stop. The P1 table keeps `default prevented` (event.defaultPrevented read after the handler) next to `cancelable`. Record it; do not judge it. K11 uses only `reaches the page` and `browser acted`. Both integration and T1 were rebased on main at f503cff. Rebase kept both work-log entries when their append points conflicted. Prior proposal above is now accepted. No other task is released.


## 11. P1 result stop, 2026-10-30

Evidence commit: `d524fa317a91236482ac0be26c7c4b070a65605c` on `codex/mc-t1`. Table: `docs/research/mc/p1-keys.md`. First line: `Firefox NOT TRACED`. Chrome version: Google Chrome 156.0.8078.47. All 31 required Chrome K11 keys reached the page and had no observed browser action. The table records `cancelable` and `default prevented` next to each other per O9; neither is a K11 judgement input. Ctrl+9 uses the separate nonlast-tab retest, not the invalid same-tab observation.

Controls: Ctrl+T visibly opened New Tab; Ctrl+W closed its only browser window. Both controls passed, exit 0. Chrome keys and the corrected Ctrl+9 retest exit 0. Fresh first-click audio: suspended to running. Real Esc under pointer lock: lock true to false, no Escape keydown at the page. Root independently matched all 31 table rows to raw key events, checked F10/Ctrl+9 screenshots, ran bash -n and verified all five SHA256 receipt entries, exit 0.

Firefox effort: 04:17:20 to about 04:19:38 UTC (2m18s), unrestricted session. Version command stalled in snap-confine D state. Headed control attempt returned no window, exit 10 after 11.38s. All Firefox rows NOT TRACED. Safari and seven supplementary Chrome pointer-input rows NOT TRACED. No browser experiments after this stop. Snap child PID 132330 remained in D state at builder handoff; no system files or other browser sessions were changed.

The CEO must pick K11 with the Chrome table. No pick is inferred. No task merge, re-gate, wave completion, push or hosted CI is claimed. Both worktrees remain for review. All tasks except T1 are NOT STARTED.

Run2 final: ux-designer PASS for the stopped evidence handoff, no High findings; T1 overall incomplete. G-QA/hash checks exit 0; scratch-only copied-log corruption red exit 1, restored exit 0. Review saved in [[Reports/2026-10-30 MC P1 review]]. Root re-ran G-QA on integration and git diff --check: all exit 0.


## 12. CEO release and disk control, 2026-10-30

[[Decisions/2026-10-30 MC Firefox deferral and continue]] releases the Firefox stop. K11(a) stays; Firefox remains NOT TRACED. Prior stopped-state entries above are historical. Remaining P1 pointer rows were completed in run3 before merge.

No active Cargo, Rust, Trunk or TuRTS process was present at cleanup. Removed only obsolete generated gate2-player/{debug,wasm-bindgen,wasm-opt,wasm-release,wasm32-unknown-unknown}, gate2-sim/debug, claude-verify/debug, and main debug/incremental. Reclaimed 26,027,208,704 bytes (24.24GiB); free space rose from557GiB to581GiB. Retained old evidence and source worktrees. Receipt: main target/cleanup-archive/20261030-mc-cache-cleanup.json. New build lanes use debug=0 and incremental=0. Delete task targets/worktrees after each verified merge; retain only compact evidence.

Warm cache rule: only one full workspace compiler cache is kept. Root transfers it by rename between idle lane targets; there is no symlink/hardlink sharing and no concurrent mutation. Required CARGO_TARGET_DIR remains specific to the executing lane. Scoped test outputs are disposable once their durable logs exist.


## 13. T1 gate and T2a ready

AfterT1 all ten required gate commands passed, frozen hash unchanged; source8f612a3. Logs: target/mc-evidence/after-t1/results.json. Removed the clean merged T1 worktree; no T1 build cache exists. Branch retained.

T2a sourcee8f9e02: independent review PASS, plant red101/restored0, taskG-RUST/G-QA all0. Warm-cache relocation initially exposed a stale local net-protocol artifact: Clippy failed to find the newtypes despite correct committed source. Invalidating all workspace packages with cargo clean -p (keeping third-party dependencies) fixed this; fresh-local strictclippy/wasm/workspacetests/boundary/G-QA allpassed. No source change was needed. Preserve failed gate log as an artifact, not semantic-red evidence. Logs: target/mc-evidence/task-t2a andtask-t2a-fresh-local; reviewer target/mc-evidence/t2a-review/report.md. Future cache transfers invalidate localworkspacepackages before verification.

T2a merged17286b1; after-t2a G-RUST/G-QA/G-FROZEN all0, workspace799/0/18, frozenhash unchanged. CleanmergedT2alane removed. Onecache moved toT3, tenlocalworkspace packages invalidated before fullslot release.
