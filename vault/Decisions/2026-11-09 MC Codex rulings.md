# MC Codex rulings

## C179: measure the actual hardware WebGPU adapter

Conflict: tests/browser/measure.js:178-198 requires nvidiaAdapter for VIS2 readiness and includes a NVIDIA-specific metadata fallback. Design9.1 requires headed Chrome WebGPU measurements at5000units with no budget; it does not set a GPU vendor. The plan Task13step5 names the desktop RTX3080 as the machine record. The laptop handoff requires honest actual hardware metadata.

Choice: remove the vendor as a pass condition. Keep actual complete adapter metadata, a configured acquired device/context, actual submitted draw calls and texture acquisitions, WebGPU backend, a non-software adapter, headed mode,5000replicated and rendered units, and finite positive frame/memory metrics. NVIDIA may remain diagnostic data. Test alternate hardware vendors and rejected software/incomplete/device-less evidence with bounded pure controls; actual headed measurement is still mandatory. No performance threshold, simulated hardware or fallback measurement is authorized.

Evidence: design9.1 draw-method measurement clause; planTask13step5; measure.js:178-198; [[Reports/2026-11-01 MC laptop handoff]]. Alternative not taken: reject valid Intel/AMD hardware, disguise software rendering as GPU proof, delete adapter metadata, or change the acceptance row.68/170runs;15/25complete.
